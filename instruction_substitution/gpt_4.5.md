## Prompt:

> Deobfuscate this x86 assembly code and provide the simplified logic in pseudocode. Remove all obfuscation noise and focus on the core functionality,  presenting it as clearly as possible.

## Response:
Below is the simplified pseudocode representation of the given obfuscated x86 assembly, stripped of the noise and presented in a clear logical structure:

### **Simplified Pseudocode:**

```c
int simplified_logic(int input) {
    int remainder = input & 3; // equivalent to input % 4
    int result;

    if (remainder == 0) {
        result = ((~input & 0xE6C98769) | ((~0xBAAAD0BF) & 0xE6C98769) | ((0xFFFFFFFF ^ 0xE6C98769) & (~input)))
                 ^ 2;
        result *= ((input & result) | (~input & 2));
    } else if (remainder == 1) {
        result = ((~input | (~0xBAAAD0BF)) & (0xFFFFFFFF | 0x8ABD1CD5));
        result *= (0 - (0 - 3 + (0 - input)));
    } else if (remainder == 2) {
        result = (((~input & 0x0F603E35) | (input & (~0x0F603E35))) ^ ((~0xBAAAD0BF & 0x0F603E35) | (0xBAAAD0BF & (~0x0F603E35))))
                 | 0x811D5B51;
        result *= result;
    } else { // remainder == 3
        result = ((0 - input) + (0 - 0xBAAAD0BF));
        result *= ((~input | 5) & 0xF4577A2A);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### **What the Original Obfuscated Code Does (Plain English):**

*   Computes the input modulo 4 (`input % 4`).
    
*   Performs different complicated bitwise manipulations depending on whether the remainder is `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`.
    
*   Returns the result of these bitwise/arithmetic manipulations as output.
    

### **Core functionality (high-level):**

The code is essentially a dispatcher function that uses `input % 4` to select among four distinct branches, each performing arbitrary bitwise transformations and multiplications. The complexity is artificially introduced through obfuscated XOR, AND, OR, and negations. The genuine purpose is a conditional transformation function based solely on modulo-4 of the input.

This logic is typical of software-protection schemes or puzzle-like obfuscation methods, designed purely to complicate static analysis. The core meaningful behavior boils down strictly to branching based on modulo-4 arithmetic and applying different hardcoded arithmetic/bitwise operations.

## Prompt:
I think the code can be obfuscated more, utilize mov eax, 0xffffffff at 0x27 and mov ecx, 0xffffffff at 0xbc to simplify bitwise operations. Provide core logic in pseudocode without obfuscation.

## Response:
You're rightâ€”the existing instructions (`mov eax, 0xffffffff` at `0x27` and `mov ecx, 0xffffffff` at `0xbc`) indicate these registers are being used simply to invert values via XOR. Recognizing this allows the pseudocode to be simplified significantly.

Here's the fully simplified pseudocode without obfuscation:

### **Simplified Pseudocode:**

```c
int simplified_logic(int input) {
    int remainder = input & 3; // input % 4
    int result;

    if (remainder == 0) {
        result = (input ^ 0xFFFFFFFF ^ 0xE6C98769 ^ 0xBAAAD0BF) ^ 2;
        result *= (input & result) | (~input & 2);
    } else if (remainder == 1) {
        result = (~input | 0xBAAAD0BF) & 0x8ABD1CD5;
        result *= (input - 3);
    } else if (remainder == 2) {
        result = ((~input & 0x0F603E35) | (input & ~0x0F603E35)) ^ (0xBAAAD0BF & 0x0F603E35);
        result ^= 0x811D5B51 | 4;
        result *= result;
    } else { // remainder == 3
        result = (-input - 0xBAAAD0BF);
        result *= ((~input | 5) & 0xF4577A2A);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### **What the Original Code Actually Does (Clearly Stated):**

*   The function branches solely based on the remainder of `input % 4`.
    
*   Each branch applies distinct constant-based bitwise and arithmetic transformations:
    
    *   **Remainder 0:** Combines inverted input with fixed constants and multiplies by a masked combination of input.
        
    *   **Remainder 1:** Combines inverted input with constants, multiplies by `(input - 3)`.
        
    *   **Remainder 2:** Applies XOR combinations of constants and inverted input, resulting in a squared term.
        
    *   **Remainder 3:** Performs arithmetic negation with a constant, multiplying by masked inverse input.
        

### **Why It Looks Complex (Obfuscation Technique):**

The complexity is purely artificial, utilizing XOR, AND, OR, NOT operations with fixed constants to obscure straightforward arithmetic logic. Recognizing repeated patterns and constants simplifies it to the presented clear logic above.

## Prompt:
Recognize the logic uses a switch on edi & 3, with edi input from 0x7. Provide structured pseudocode using switch (input & 3) clearly defining functional cases.

## Response:
Here's structured pseudocode clearly defined as a `switch` statement based on the input modulo 4 (`input & 3`). The logic is simplified and explicitly represents the original functionality without obfuscation noise:

### Structured Pseudocode:

```c
int process_input(int input) {
    int result;

    switch (input & 3) {
        case 0:
            // Case 0 logic
            result = (~input ^ 0xE6C98769 ^ 0xBAAAD0BF) ^ 2;
            result *= ((input & result) | (~input & 2));
            break;

        case 1:
            // Case 1 logic
            result = (~input | 0xBAAAD0BF) & 0x8ABD1CD5;
            result *= (input - 3);
            break;

        case 2:
            // Case 2 logic
            result = ((~input & 0x0F603E35) | (input & ~0x0F603E35)) ^ (0xBAAAD0BF & 0x0F603E35);
            result ^= (0x811D5B51 | 4);
            result *= result;
            break;

        case 3:
            // Case 3 logic
            result = -(input + 0xBAAAD0BF);
            result *= ((~input | 5) & 0xF4577A2A);
            break;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Clearly Stated Logic:

*   The core decision-making logic (`switch`) depends on the last two bits of the input (`input & 3`), equivalent to `input % 4`.
    
*   Each case executes a distinct arithmetic and bitwise manipulation intended solely for obfuscation or conditional hashing.
    
*   The constants are arbitrary and meant to disguise simpler logical intentions.

## Prompt:
Interpret the switch from comparisons at 0x1a, 0xaa, and 0x106. Identify key computation blocks (0x27, 0xb7, 0x113, 0x1ac). Ignore extraneous inc instructions, presenting logic as unsigned int function(unsigned int input) in C with a switch structure.

## Response:
Below is the precise interpretation of the original assembly, structured explicitly into a clear, simplified `switch` statement, identified by the comparisons at addresses `0x1a`, `0xaa`, and `0x106`, and focusing on the main computation blocks at addresses `0x27`, `0xb7`, `0x113`, and `0x1ac`. All extraneous `inc` operations (obfuscation noise) have been ignored:

### Structured C implementation:

```c
unsigned int function(unsigned int input) {
    unsigned int result = 0;

    switch (input & 3) {
        case 0:  // from comparison at 0x1a, computation block at 0x27
            result = ((~input ^ 0xBAAAD0BF) & (input ^ 0xE6C98769)) ^ 2;
            result *= ((input & result) | (~input & 2));
            break;

        case 1:  // from comparison at 0xaa, computation block at 0xb7
            result = (~input | 0xBAAAD0BF) & 0x8ABD1CD5;
            result *= (input - 3);
            break;

        case 2:  // from comparison at 0x106, computation block at 0x113
            result = ((~input & 0x0F603E35) | (input & ~0x0F603E35))
                     ^ ((0xBAAAD0BF & 0x0F603E35) | (0xFFFFFFFF & ~0x0F603E35));
            result ^= (0x811D5B51 | 4);
            result *= result;
            break;

        case 3:  // default case, computation block at 0x1ac
            result = -(input + 0xBAAAD0BF);
            result *= ((~input | 5) & 0xF4577A2A);
            break;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Key points identified clearly:

*   **Switch logic:**  
    Determined explicitly by `(input & 3)` at comparisons at `0x1a`, `0xaa`, and `0x106`.
    
*   **Main Computation Blocks:**
    
    *   **`0x27`** (case 0): Complex bitwise XOR and AND inversion, multiplied by conditional masked input.
        
    *   **`0xb7`** (case 1): Bitwise OR-inversion masked by constant, multiplied by arithmetic difference.
        
    *   **`0x113`** (case 2): XOR/AND masks involving complementary constants squared.
        
    *   **`0x1ac`** (case 3): Negation-based arithmetic masked with bitwise inversion and constants.
        
*   **Ignored instructions:**  
    All extraneous increment (`inc`) instructions and irrelevant stack manipulation instructions have been omitted as intentional obfuscation.
    

### Practical interpretation:

The simplified, clear pseudocode demonstrates the underlying functionality without distraction from intentional obfuscation noise, clearly exposing the conditional structure and logical intent of the original assembly.

## Prompt:
Focus on constants (0xbaaad0bf, 0xe6c98769, 0x8abd1cd5, 0xf603e35, 0xf4577a2a) used in bitwise operations and multiplications. Discard redundant bitwise manipulations, clearly deriving arithmetic transformations. Simplify to core arithmetic transformations in concise C code.

## Response:
Below is the concise and fully simplified arithmetic-centric logic extracted clearly from the provided assembly code, explicitly highlighting only relevant arithmetic transformations involving the given constants (`0xbaaad0bf`, `0xe6c98769`, `0x8abd1cd5`, `0x0f603e35`, `0xf4577a2a`).

### Simplified, Core Arithmetic Transformations in C:

```c
unsigned int function(unsigned int input) {
    switch (input & 3) {
        case 0:
            return ((~input ^ 0xBAAAD0BF ^ 0xE6C98769) + 2) * (input | 2);

        case 1:
            return ((~input | 0xBAAAD0BF) & 0x8ABD1CD5) * (input - 3);

        case 2:
            return ((input ^ 0x0F603E35 ^ 0xBAAAD0BF) + 0x811D5B55) * (input ^ 0x0F603E35 ^ 0xBAAAD0BF);

        case 3:
            return (-(input + 0xBAAAD0BF)) * ((~input | 5) & 0xF4577A2A);
    }

    return 0; // Unreachable
}
```

### Rationale (clearly stated):

*   **Case `0`**:  
    Combines input inversion (`~input`) with constants `0xBAAAD0BF` and `0xE6C98769`, then applies simple arithmetic scaling.
    
*   **Case `1`**:  
    Uses the inverted input masked against constants, then linearly scaled by `(input - 3)`.
    
*   **Case `2`**:  
    Performs XOR-based arithmetic involving constants `0x0F603E35` and `0xBAAAD0BF`, shifted by `0x811D5B55`, and squared.
    
*   **Case `3`**:  
    Negates arithmetic sum with `0xBAAAD0BF`, multiplied by masked input with constant `0xF4577A2A`.
    

### Clearly Defined Arithmetic Intent:

These transformations represent deliberately complex numeric mappings likely intended as simple arithmetic hashes or verification checks rather than functional logic.
