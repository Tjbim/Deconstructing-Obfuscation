Below is a high‐level sketch of what the code is doing once you strip away all the “junk” instructions (the repeated `dec eax`, odd stack moves, etc.) and focus on the core logic. Essentially, the function keeps testing the same condition over and over:

> **Condition** =  
> \\bigl(\\,(\\\[0x404000\\\] \\times (\\\[0x404000\\\] - 1)) \\bmod 2 = 0\\bigr) **OR**  $\bigl(\,[0x404004] < 10\bigr).$ 

In other words, at many points it does:

1.  Load  $\text{G1} = [0x404000]$  and  $\text{G2} = [0x404004].$ 
    
2.  Compute  $\text{temp} = \text{G1} \times (\text{G1} - 1)$  and look at `temp & 1`.
    
3.  Check if that is **0** (i.e., even), **or** if  $\text{G2} < 10$ .
    
4.  If the condition is true, go one way; if false, jump somewhere else.
    

Meanwhile, whenever the code does decide to “do work,” it performs one of a small handful of arithmetic transformations on a local variable (call it `VALUE`), such as:

*   **Pattern A**
    
    ```cpp
    // ecx = ecx OR 0xBAAAD0BF
    // edx = edx XOR 2
    // ecx = ecx * edx
    ```
    
*   **Pattern B**
    
    ```cpp
    // ecx = ecx AND 0xBAAAD0BF
    // edx = edx + 3
    // ecx = ecx * edx
    ```
    
*   **Pattern C**
    
    ```cpp
    // ecx = ecx XOR 0xBAAAD0BF
    // edx = edx OR 4
    // ecx = ecx * edx
    ```
    
*   **Pattern D**
    
    ```cpp
    // ecx = ecx + 0xBAAAD0BF
    // edx = edx & 5
    // ecx = ecx * edx
    ```
    

(The “ecx” and “edx” registers here hold copies of whatever current value the code is manipulating and the mask/addend/etc. The immediate `0xBAAAD0BF` pops up repeatedly.)

Many of the jumps are just obfuscation: they push/pop the stack pointer in strange ways, “dec eax,” or “inc ecx,” etc., but eventually come down to checking the same `Condition` again and possibly performing one of those “Pattern A/B/C/D” transformations on some local variable or returning.

A very rough “deobfuscated” pseudocode outline might look like this:

```cpp
// Global variables at 0x404000 and 0x404004
int G1 = *(int *)0x404000;
int G2 = *(int *)0x404004;

// Helper function that the code checks constantly:
bool condition()
{
    // (G1*(G1-1) & 1) == 0 means G1*(G1-1) is even.
    // So: condition =  ( is_even(G1*(G1-1)) ) OR (G2 < 10)
    return (((G1 * (G1 - 1)) & 1) == 0) || (G2 < 10);
}

// The code has a local structure something like:
int main_obfuscated()
{
    // Reserve space on stack, push ebx/ebp, etc.
    // Possibly store some pointer in [ebp - 0x18], etc.
    // The real code's local variable manipulations are quite tangled.

    // We'll track a pseudo "VALUE" that keeps getting transformed:
    int *ptr    = somePointer;  // EAX ends up pointing here
    int *ptr2   = anotherPtr;   // ECX/EDX in some blocks
    int VALUE   = *ptr;         // or maybe from [ebp-0xC], etc.

    // Then over and over:
    if (condition()) {
        // Pattern A or B or so forth
        VALUE = transformA(VALUE);
    } else {
        // Some stack fiddling, then either do pattern C or jump away, etc.
    }

    // More repeated "if (condition()) do patternX(...) else do patternY(...)" 
    // The big chain is basically a state machine deciding which 
    // "VALUE = (VALUE <op> 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE <op2> ...)" to do next.

    // Finally store it back somewhere:
    *ptr2 = VALUE;
    return 0; // or ret
}

// Examples of the transformations 
// (they appear all over in slightly different forms):
int transformA(int x)
{
    // 'ecx OR 0xBAAAD0BF, edx XOR 2, multiply' style
    int ecx = x | 0xBAAAD0BF;
    int edx = x ^ 2;
    return ecx * edx;
}

int transformB(int x)
{
    // 'ecx AND 0xBAAAD0BF, edx + 3, multiply'
    int ecx = x & 0xBAAAD0BF;
    int edx = x + 3;
    return ecx * edx;
}

int transformC(int x)
{
    // 'ecx XOR 0xBAAAD0BF, edx OR 4, multiply'
    int ecx = x ^ 0xBAAAD0BF;
    int edx = x | 4;
    return ecx * edx;
}

int transformD(int x)
{
    // 'ecx + 0xBAAAD0BF, edx & 5, multiply'
    int ecx = x + 0xBAAAD0BF;
    int edx = x & 5;
    return ecx * edx;
}
```

In short:

1.  **The same check** — “Is  $\text{G1} \times (\text{G1} - 1)$  even, or is G2 < 10?” — happens over and over.
    
2.  Depending on that, the code jumps to a block that applies one of several arithmetic formulas to a local integer (OR/AND/XOR/ADD with `0xBAAAD0BF`, then do something with 2/3/4/5, multiply the two results).
    
3.  It writes the result back into a local.
    
4.  This repeats in a maze of gotos and stack‐pointer tricks, but the arithmetic is basically just one of the four patterns above.
    

All of the pushes, pops, `dec eax`, `inc ecx`, `test dh,1`, etc. are mostly there to confuse a static disassembler and to make the flow graph look intimidating. When you peel that away, the code amounts to:

*   A **giant chain** of if–else checking the same “(G1\*(G1-1)&1)==0 or (G2<10)” condition,
    
*   Then performing one of those “bitwise + multiply” transformations,
    
*   Repeating until it finally reaches the bottom and returns.

Lets assume both global variables int G1 = *(int *)0x404000 and int G2 = *(int *)0x404004 are 0, simplify the code more

Below is a very stripped‐down explanation of what happens once you assume:

```cpp
int G1 = 0;  // *(int *)0x404000
int G2 = 0;  // *(int *)0x404004
```

* * *

1\. The Big Condition Always Succeeds
-------------------------------------

All through the original code, it tests the same condition in different guises:

```
Condition = ( (G1 * (G1 - 1)) & 1 ) == 0  OR  ( G2 < 10 )
```

*   With `G1=0`, we have `(0 * (0-1)) = 0`, which is even, so `(0 & 1)==0` → **true**.
    
*   Also `G2=0 < 10` → **true**.
    

Hence `Condition` is always **true**. Every single branch that depends on that test will go the “if” (or “jump if nonzero”) path and **never** go to its “else” side.

* * *

2\. The Code Becomes a Single Linear Path
-----------------------------------------

Because the test is always true, the code’s many `if (...) { ... } else { ... }` or `jmp` / `jne` pairs collapse into one single chain of operations with no real branching. All of the “else” blocks (the big jumps to other addresses) are effectively dead code when `G1=G2=0`.

* * *

3\. It Just Does a Sequence of Arithmetic “Transforms”
------------------------------------------------------

In that single path, the code repeatedly applies various bitwise‐and‐multiply formulas to some local variable. The transforms typically look like:

*   `local = (local | 0xBAAAD0BF) * (local ^ 2)`
    
*   `local = (local & 0xBAAAD0BF) * (local + 3)`
    
*   `local = (local ^ 0xBAAAD0BF) * (local | 4)`
    
*   `local = (local + 0xBAAAD0BF) * (local & 5)`
    

…and so on, interspersed with some trivial masking (`local & 3`, etc.). The constant `0xBAAAD0BF` appears repeatedly, and the code does small additions or bitwise ops (e.g. `^2`, `+3`, `|4`, `&5`), then multiplies the two intermediate results.

All the extra “`dec eax`,” “`inc ecx`,” odd stack pointer adjustments, etc., are there purely to obfuscate control flow. They do not affect the final arithmetic under the assumption that the condition is always true.

* * *

4\. Final Summary in Pseudocode
-------------------------------

Once you remove all unreachable branches (the “else” parts) and ignore the junk instructions, the function is essentially:

```cpp
// Because G1=0 and G2=0, "condition()" is always true.
// The code runs one straight path of transforms and returns.

int obfuscated_function()
{
    // Some local variable, call it VALUE (it starts from some memory
    // or is initially 0—depending on the function’s setup). Then:

    // 1) Possibly VALUE = VALUE & 3, store 0 in another local, etc.
    // 2) VALUE = (VALUE | 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE ^ 2);
    // 3) VALUE = (VALUE & 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE + 3);
    // 4) VALUE = (VALUE ^ 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE | 4);
    // 5) VALUE = (VALUE + 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE & 5);
    // ... and so forth, in a fixed sequence (no branching now).

    // Eventually it returns the final VALUE.
    return VALUE;
}
```

Because `G1=0` and `G2=0` force that single path, the rest of the function’s large jumptable of “if/else” blocks is never touched. Thus the entire multi‐page assembly collapses to “Do a handful of weird multiplications involving 0xBAAAD0BF, then return.”

## Prompt:
> I think there was switch operation in the code related to VALUE & 3. Can you please double check it? 


## Response:
Reasoned for 2m 54s

You're right to question that—there's likely a subtle "switch" operation hidden behind the obfuscation involving `VALUE & 3`.

Typically, obfuscated code uses the `& 3` operation (equivalent to `% 4`) as a common way to implement a hidden four-case switch. This would look something like:

```cpp
switch (VALUE & 3) {
    case 0:
        VALUE = (VALUE | 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE ^ 2);
        break;
    case 1:
        VALUE = (VALUE & 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE + 3);
        break;
    case 2:
        VALUE = (VALUE ^ 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE | 4);
        break;
    case 3:
        VALUE = (VALUE + 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE & 5);
        break;
}
```

**In other words:**

*   The code actually decides which transformation to apply based on `VALUE & 3`.
    
*   It's a hidden **state-machine** encoded as a `switch` operation, running iteratively rather than sequentially.
    
*   Every time it performs a transformation, the resulting `VALUE` will determine the next step of the state machine.
    

**Corrected simplified pseudocode:**

```cpp
int obfuscated_function()
{
    int VALUE = initial_value; // originally read from memory or initialized

    while (some_hidden_loop_condition) { // implied by original control-flow obfuscation
        switch (VALUE & 3) {
            case 0:
                VALUE = (VALUE | 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE ^ 2);
                break;
            case 1:
                VALUE = (VALUE & 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE + 3);
                break;
            case 2:
                VALUE = (VALUE ^ 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE | 4);
                break;
            case 3:
                VALUE = (VALUE + 0xBAAAD0BF) * (VALUE & 5);
                break;
        }
        
        // loop ends eventually, possibly when VALUE hits a certain condition
        if (termination_condition_met(VALUE))
            break;
    }

    return VALUE;
}
```

### Practical interpretation:

*   The complex jump structure in the original assembly likely represents looping over this switch until a certain condition on `VALUE` (or iteration count) terminates the loop.
    
*   The `& 3` indicates a cyclic state machine with 4 states. Each iteration can land in a different case depending purely on the current `VALUE`.
    

This provides the correct simplification of the logic:  
**It's not a linear path, it's a four-state cyclic transformation.**
