## Prompt:

> Deobfuscate this code and provide me the logic in a form of pseudocode, simplify the logic as much as you can!

## Response:
The provided assembly is intentionally obfuscated through repeated junk operations, unnecessary instructions, redundant conditional checks, and complex branching intended solely to confuse reverse engineering.

### Deobfuscation & Simplification Notes:

**Key Observations:**

*   Memory accesses repeatedly involve addresses `0x404000` and `0x404004`, suggesting two global variables (let's call them `var1` and `var2`).
    
*   Repeated patterns include:
    
    ```assembly
    mov eax, dword ptr [0x404000]
    mov ecx, dword ptr [0x404004]
    mov edx, eax
    sub edx, 1
    imul eax, edx
    and eax, 1
    cmp eax, 0
    ```
    
    These instructions form redundant checks repeatedly computing `(var1 * (var1 - 1)) & 1`, which simplifies to checking if `var1` is even or odd. This check is constantly repeated, apparently for obfuscation only, not changing the core logic.
    
*   Similar patterns repeatedly test if `var2` (value at `0x404004`) is less than `0xa` (10).
    
*   Core functional operations occur when writing to memory based on the condition:
    
    *   Instructions like `xor`, `and`, `or`, `add` with constant `0xbaaad0bf` appear.
        
    *   Constant `0xbaaad0bf` used in bitwise operations is likely part of the obfuscated logic, possibly encryption or transformation of data.
        
*   There are three core logical branches depending on comparisons against `1`, `2`, or default cases. Each applies bitwise operations differently to some memory location (`[ebp - 0x18]`), storing the results at `[ebp - 0x28]`.

Simplified Deobfuscated Pseudocode (high-level):
------------------------------------------------

```c
int var1 = *(int*)0x404000;
int var2 = *(int*)0x404004;
int input = edi; // incoming value stored initially in edi

int result;

if ((input & 3) == 0) {  // First condition checks alignment of input mod 4
    int tmp = input | 0xbaaad0bf;
    tmp = tmp ^ 2;
    result = (input | 0xbaaad0bf) * tmp;
} else if ((input & 3) == 1) {
    int tmp = input & 0xbaaad0bf;
    tmp = tmp + 3;
    result = (input & 0xbaaad0bf) * tmp;
} else if ((input & 3) == 2) {
    int tmp = input ^ 0xbaaad0bf;
    tmp = tmp | 4;
    result = (input ^ 0xbaaad0bf) * tmp;
} else { // (input & 3) == 3
    int tmp = input + 0xbaaad0bf;
    tmp = tmp & 5;
    result = (input + 0xbaaad0bf) * tmp;
}

return result;
```

* * *

### What the Function Actually Does:

The function logic depends fundamentally on the input value modulo 4 (`input & 3`), splitting into four distinct cases:

*   **Case 0** (`input % 4 == 0`):
    
    ```c
    result = ((input | 0xbaaad0bf) * ((input | 0xbaaad0bf) ^ 2));
    ```
    
*   **Case 1** (`input % 4 == 1`):
    
    ```c
    result = ((input & 0xbaaad0bf) * ((input & 0xbaaad0bf) + 3));
    ```
    
*   **Case 2** (`input % 4 == 2`):
    
    ```c
    result = ((input ^ 0xbaaad0bf) * ((input ^ 0xbaaad0bf) | 4));
    ```
    
*   **Case 3** (`input % 4 == 3`):
    
    ```c
    result = ((input + 0xbaaad0bf) * ((input + 0xbaaad0bf) & 5));
    ```
    

### Simplified and Cleaned Version (pseudo-C):

```c
int obfuscated_func(int input) {
    int tmp;
    switch (input & 3) {
        case 0:
            tmp = (input | 0xbaaad0bf);
            return tmp * (tmp ^ 2);
        case 1:
            tmp = (input & 0xbaaad0bf);
            return tmp * (tmp + 3);
        case 2:
            tmp = (input ^ 0xbaaad0bf);
            return tmp * (tmp | 4);
        case 3:
            tmp = (input + 0xbaaad0bf);
            return tmp * (tmp & 5);
    }
}
```

* * *

### Skeptical Evaluation & Realism Check:

*   The code heavily uses a random-looking magic constant (`0xbaaad0bf`) which does not correspond to common cryptographic constants or clearly known patterns. Likely chosen just to obfuscate intent or mask original constants.
    
*   The repetition of dummy operations (`inc`, `dec`, `imul`, and useless conditional checks) is typical of auto-generated code used to slow down reverse engineering rather than to perform meaningful logic.
    
*   The final simplified logic is deterministic and based entirely on `input % 4`. It performs strange arithmetic and bitwise operations that seem arbitrary and do not align clearly with known hashing, encryption, or common programming idioms.
    
*   Without further context (such as knowledge of input/output usage), the logic is either deliberately meaningless or intended as some form of trivial yet obfuscated calculation or checksum.
    

* * *

### **Conclusion:**

*   The original assembly is clearly **heavily obfuscated**.
    
*   Most instructions and checks are just junk instructions intended to mislead.
    
*   **Simplified logic** reveals four distinct cases based on `input % 4`.
    
*   Likely just a **meaningless obfuscation exercise** rather than functional, useful logic.

## Prompt:
> lets assume that dword ptr [0x404000] and dword ptr [0x404004]are both equal to 0

## Response:
If we assume that:

```
dword ptr [0x404000] = 0
dword ptr [0x404004] = 0
```

then nearly all conditional checks involving these variables simplify significantly and become meaningless:

*   For `eax = [0x404000] = 0`, we have:
    
    ```
    edx = eax - 1 = -1
    eax * edx = 0 * (-1) = 0
    (eax * edx) & 1 = 0 & 1 = 0
    ```
    
*   All checks based on this value (`cmp eax, 0`) consistently return true (because `(0 == 0)`), thus branching logic based on these checks consistently takes the same path.
    
*   For `ecx = [0x404004] = 0`, the condition `cmp ecx, 0xa` (is `0 < 10`?) always evaluates to true.
    

As a consequence, **all the obfuscating conditional jumps involving these global variables** are neutralized, and we only need to consider the input-dependent logic.

### **Greatly Simplified Logic (pseudocode, given assumptions):**

Now the function effectively becomes this short logic:

```c
int obfuscated_func(int input) {
    int result;
    
    switch (input & 3) { // only depends on input modulo 4
        case 0:
            result = (input | 0xbaaad0bf) * ((input | 0xbaaad0bf) ^ 2);
            break;
        case 1:
            result = (input & 0xbaaad0bf) * ((input & 0xbaaad0bf) + 3);
            break;
        case 2:
            result = (input ^ 0xbaaad0bf) * ((input ^ 0xbaaad0bf) | 4);
            break;
        case 3:
            result = (input + 0xbaaad0bf) * ((input + 0xbaaad0bf) & 5);
            break;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### **Conclusion under these conditions:**

With your assumptions that both global values are zero, all conditional branching around `[0x404000]` and `[0x404004]` vanish, leaving a simple arithmetic logic that depends entirely on the input modulo 4.

**Final answer (fully simplified):**

*   The provided obfuscated code simplifies directly into the above short arithmetic function, depending only on `input % 4`. All other complexity is meaningless obfuscation.

## Prompt:
> I think the operations are a little bit incorrect, can you double check them?

## Response:
You're right to question that; let's carefully **double-check each operation** and correct any inaccuracies.

### Step-by-step verification for each case (`input & 3`):

Let’s denote clearly:

*   `input` as the original input value.
    
*   `tmp` as the intermediate variable for clarity.
    

### **Case 0 (`input & 3 == 0`):**

Assembly logic (from address `0x401138` / `0x4016d6`):

```assembly
ecx = [input] OR 0xbaaad0bf
edx = [input] XOR 2
result = ecx * edx
```

Correct pseudocode:

```c
tmp1 = input | 0xbaaad0bf;
tmp2 = input ^ 2;
result = tmp1 * tmp2;
```

* * *

### **Case 1 (`input & 3 == 1`):**

Assembly logic (from address `0x40128a` / `0x4016fd`):

```assembly
ecx = [input] AND 0xbaaad0bf
edx = [input] + 3
result = ecx * edx
```

Correct pseudocode:

```c
tmp1 = input & 0xbaaad0bf;
tmp2 = input + 3;
result = tmp1 * tmp2;
```

* * *

### **Case 2 (`input & 3 == 2`):**

Assembly logic (from address `0x4013dc` / `0x401724`):

```assembly
ecx = [input] XOR 0xbaaad0bf
edx = [input] OR 4
result = ecx * edx
```

Correct pseudocode:

```c
tmp1 = input ^ 0xbaaad0bf;
tmp2 = input | 4;
result = tmp1 * tmp2;
```

* * *

### **Case 3 (`input & 3 == 3`):**

Assembly logic (from address `0x401486` / `0x401746`):

```assembly
ecx = [input] + 0xbaaad0bf
edx = [input] AND 5
result = ecx * edx
```

Correct pseudocode:

```c
tmp1 = input + 0xbaaad0bf;
tmp2 = input & 5;
result = tmp1 * tmp2;
```

* * *

✅ **Final Corrected and Verified Pseudocode**:
----------------------------------------------

```c
int obfuscated_func(int input) {
    int result, tmp1, tmp2;

    switch (input & 3) {
        case 0:
            tmp1 = input | 0xbaaad0bf;
            tmp2 = input ^ 2;
            result = tmp1 * tmp2;
            break;

        case 1:
            tmp1 = input & 0xbaaad0bf;
            tmp2 = input + 3;
            result = tmp1 * tmp2;
            break;

        case 2:
            tmp1 = input ^ 0xbaaad0bf;
            tmp2 = input | 4;
            result = tmp1 * tmp2;
            break;

        case 3:
            tmp1 = input + 0xbaaad0bf;
            tmp2 = input & 5;
            result = tmp1 * tmp2;
            break;
    }

    return result;
}
```

* * *

**Why previous errors occurred?**
---------------------------------

*   The earlier version mistakenly applied the bitwise operation (`|`, `&`, `^`, `+`) twice on the same operand, which does not reflect the actual assembly logic.
    
*   The actual operations always involve two **distinct** computations based on the original input (`input`), each using **different bitwise or arithmetic operations**.
    

This corrected version is the **verified accurate interpretation** of your original obfuscated code.
