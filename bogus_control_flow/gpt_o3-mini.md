## Response:
Reasoned about code deobfuscation logic for 44 seconds

Below is one “deobfuscated‐in spirit” interpretation. (Note that the original code is extremely tangled—it repeatedly computes “flags” from two globals (at 0x404000 and 0x404004) and then uses dozens of jumps and dummy stack adjustments to “hide” its true intent. In short, it looks like a state‐machine (or virtual machine) that repeatedly tests conditions and applies one of several arithmetic “transformation” operations on a value.)

A high‐level pseudocode capturing the main ideas might look like this:

```pseudocode
function obfuscated_function():
    // --- Function Prologue: Set up stack frame and locals ---
    initialize_stack_frame()
    // globals: param1 = *(0x404000), param2 = *(0x404004)

    // Main loop: repeatedly test conditions and perform transformations
    while True:
        // --- Block 1: Compute a flag based on global parameters ---
        // Compute: flag = (((param1 - 1) * param1) & 1 == 0) OR (param2 < 10)
        flag1 = (((param1 - 1) * param1) & 1 == 0) or (param2 < 10)
        if not flag1:
            // If the test fails, cleanup and exit
            goto cleanup_and_return

        // --- Block 2: Update local state and adjust pointers ---
        // (Lots of dec/ inc operations here are simply obfuscation.)
        local_value = get_some_local_value()   // e.g. saved from register edi
        
        // --- Block 3: Check an internal control byte ---
        control_byte = get_control_byte()        // value from a local byte variable
        if (control_byte & 1) == 0:
            // If not set, branch to one transformation branch
            flag2 = (((param1 - 1) * param1) & 1 == 0) or (param2 < 10)
            if not flag2:
                goto cleanup_and_return
            // Perform transformation variant A on a local variable
            local_value = transform_variant_A(local_value)
        else:
            // Else branch: another check and transformation variant B
            flag3 = (((param1 - 1) * param1) & 1 == 0) or (param2 < 10)
            if not flag3:
                goto cleanup_and_return
            local_value = transform_variant_B(local_value)
        
        // --- Block 4: Further state updates and arithmetic transformations ---
        // Example transformation using a “magic” constant:
        //    new_value = ( (local_value OR 0xbaaad0bf) * (local_value XOR 2) )
        local_value = complex_transform(local_value)
        
        // Additional similar blocks update other locals (using constants like 0xbaaad0bf, 3, 4, 5)
        // and then check similar conditions computed from param1 and param2.
        if not additional_conditions_met(param1, param2):
            goto cleanup_and_return

        // Possibly update some memory or local state with the computed value
        update_state(local_value)

        // Decide whether to continue looping or jump to another transformation branch
        if termination_condition_reached():
            break

    cleanup_and_return:
    // --- Function Epilogue: Restore registers and stack, then return ---
    restore_stack_frame()
    return
```

### Explanation

1.  **Global Parameters as “Control Inputs”:**  
    The code keeps reading two globals (at addresses 0x404000 and 0x404004). It uses a formula like
    
    ```
    flag = (((param1 - 1) * param1) & 1 == 0) or (param2 < 10)
    ```
    
    This is computed multiple times to decide which branch to take.
    
2.  **Obfuscated Stack Adjustments:**  
    Many instructions simply increment or decrement registers (EAX, ESP, etc.) to confuse the control flow. They’re “noise” meant to hide the actual logic.
    
3.  **State Machine / Transformation Routines:**  
    Depending on the outcome of the flag tests and a “control byte” (from a local variable), the code chooses one of several branches. In each branch it applies a non‐trivial arithmetic “transformation” on a local value using bitwise operations (OR, XOR) and multiplication with magic constants (for example, 0xbaaad0bf). There are at least two variants (A and B) and further subcases.
    
4.  **Looping and Cleanup:**  
    After applying these transformations, the code either loops (by jumping back to an earlier label) or eventually goes to a cleanup block where it undoes its stack adjustments and returns.
    

### Final Thoughts

The code is deliberately convoluted. In practice the “real” work is performed by those arithmetic transformations and the repeated conditional tests—the surrounding “push/dec/inc/jmp” instructions are mostly there to thwart reverse engineering. This pseudocode is a simplified, “what it seems to be doing” version rather than a line‐by‐line translation.

In short: the routine sets up a loop where it repeatedly checks conditions (derived from two globals) and—based on those checks—applies one of several arithmetic transformations to an internal state. When the conditions are no longer met the loop exits and the function cleans up and returns.

This is my best‐effort “deobfuscation” that captures the spirit of the code without getting lost in the many jumps and redundant operations.

## Prompt:
It is pretty hard to read, can you simplify the code even more?

## Response:
Reasoned about obfuscated code logic for 9 seconds

Here's an even more distilled version that strips away most of the noise:

```pseudocode
function obfuscated_function():
    // Initialization: set up state, read globals
    state = initial_state()       // some local state from registers/stack
    param1 = GLOBAL1              // value at 0x404000
    param2 = GLOBAL2              // value at 0x404004

    // Main loop: repeatedly modify state while conditions hold
    while true:
        // Compute a flag from the globals (e.g., based on (param1-1)*param1 and param2)
        if not condition(param1, param2):
            break  // exit loop when the condition fails

        // Check a control flag (a local byte) to decide which transformation to apply
        if not control_flag_set():
            // Transformation Variant A
            if not another_condition(param1, param2):
                break
            state = transform_variant_A(state)
        else:
            // Transformation Variant B
            if not another_condition(param1, param2):
                break
            state = transform_variant_B(state)

        // Apply an additional arithmetic transformation using magic constants
        state = complex_arithmetic_transform(state)

        // Update internal state (possibly writing it back to memory)
        update_state(state)

        // Decide whether to continue or exit the loop
        if termination_condition(state, param1, param2):
            break

    // Cleanup and return
    finalize()
    return state
```

### Explanation

*   **Initialization:**  
    The function starts by setting up a local state and reading two global values that steer its behavior.
    
*   **Main Loop:**  
    Each iteration first checks a condition derived from the globals. Then, based on a control flag, it chooses between two transformation routines (labeled A and B). A further complex transformation (involving bitwise and arithmetic operations) is applied afterward.
    
*   **Termination:**  
    The loop exits when the condition (or subsequent checks) fail, at which point the function cleans up and returns the final state.
    

This pseudocode captures the essence: a loop that uses global inputs to decide which of several arithmetic transformations to perform on an internal state before eventually terminating.

## Prompt:
lets assume that dword ptr [0x404000] and dword ptr [0x404004]are both equal to 0

## Response:
Reasoned about code with zeros for 50 seconds

Assuming both global values are 0, almost every test that depends on them will “succeed” (since the arithmetic tests based on 0 and the “0 < 10” comparisons always return true). In effect, the code’s only “real work” becomes a loop that repeatedly transforms an internal state using a few different (and confusingly mixed) arithmetic/bitwise operations. The stack‐pointer shuffling and extra jumps are there mainly to hide this fact. One simplified interpretation is:

```pseudocode
function obfuscated_function():
    // Initialize state from some initial value (from registers/stack)
    state = initial_state()    
    // Read globals (both are 0 under our assumption)
    global1 = 0  
    global2 = 0  

    // Because 0 < 10 and arithmetic with 0 always yields 0,
    // all computed “flag” conditions end up true.
    while true:
        // (Obfuscated code here repeatedly recomputes a condition like:
        //    flag = (((global1 - 1) * global1) & 1 == 0) OR (global2 < 10)
        // which is always true when global1 = global2 = 0.)

        // Decide between two transformation variants based on an internal control byte.
        if control_flag_is_set():  
            // Transformation Variant B
            // (For example, something like: take state, XOR it with a magic constant,
            //  then multiply it by (state OR 4).)
            state = (state XOR 0xbaaad0bf) * (state OR 4)
        else:
            // Transformation Variant A
            // (For example: take state, OR it with the magic constant, then multiply it
            //  by (state XOR 2).)
            state = (state OR 0xbaaad0bf) * (state XOR 2)

        // An additional transformation is applied in some iterations:
        state = additional_transform(state)

        // Check an internal termination condition (dependent only on state)
        if termination_condition_met(state):
            break

    // Final cleanup (restoring registers/stack) and return the final state
    return state
```

### In Short

When both globals are 0, every “global check” is passed. The obfuscated function enters a loop where it:

*   Chooses one of two similar arithmetic/bitwise transformations on a local state,
    
*   Applies an extra transformation,
    
*   And then eventually exits when an internal (state‐dependent) condition is met.
    

Most of the “noise” (stack adjustments, redundant jumps) is just there to confuse anyone trying to follow the logic. The core idea is simply a loop that keeps transforming a state variable until it’s “done.”

## Prompt:
Are you sure there are no constants i hidden?

## Response:
Reasoned about hidden constants for 9 seconds

There are hidden constants. For example, the magic value **0xbaaad0bf** appears repeatedly in arithmetic operations, and you also see small constants like **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, and **5** used throughout. These constants are mixed in with the obfuscation to complicate reverse engineering. So no, it’s not free of hidden constants—they're deliberately embedded to muddle the actual logic.

## Prompt:
So can try once again and provide me more organized form of the obfuscated code?

Below is one “organized” high‐level pseudocode version that groups the operations into several transformation functions. It’s important to note that the original assembly repeatedly recalculates conditions (based on two globals, here both 0) and uses several “magic” constants (like 0xbaaad0bf, 2, 3, 4, 5) to obfuscate its true intent. With both globals equal to 0 the global‐based conditions always pass, so the control flow is driven by internal control bytes. One way to capture the essence is:

```pseudocode
function obfuscated_function():
    // Initialization (the real “seed” might come from a register or earlier value)
    state    = initial_state()           // e.g. stored in a local variable
    control1 = initial_control_byte()     // from an internal byte (originally [ebp-0x29])
    
    // Main loop: keep transforming 'state' until some termination condition is met
    while not termination_condition(state):
        // Global conditions computed from GLOBAL1 and GLOBAL2 (both are 0)
        // would normally decide if we continue. Here they always allow progress.

        // Based on control1 choose one of two primary transformations:
        if (control1 & 1) == 1:
            // Transformation Variant A:
            //   state = (state OR 0xbaaad0bf) * (state XOR 2)
            state = transform_A(state)
        else:
            // Transformation Variant B:
            //   state = (state XOR 0xbaaad0bf) * (state OR 4)
            state = transform_B(state)

        // Update or compute a secondary control flag from the current state.
        control2 = compute_secondary_control(state)  // derived internally

        // Based on control2 choose a secondary transformation:
        if (control2 & 1) == 1:
            // Transformation Variant D:
            //   state = (state AND 0xbaaad0bf) * (state + 3)
            state = transform_D(state)
        else:
            // Transformation Variant C:
            //   state = (state + 0xbaaad0bf) * (state AND 5)
            state = transform_C(state)
        
        // Optionally, update the primary control flag for the next iteration
        control1 = update_control(state)

    // Cleanup and return the final transformed state.
    return state


// --- Transformation Functions ---

function transform_A(state):
    // Applies a combination of bitwise OR and XOR, then multiplies.
    return (state OR 0xbaaad0bf) * (state XOR 2)

function transform_B(state):
    // Applies a combination of bitwise XOR and OR, then multiplies.
    return (state XOR 0xbaaad0bf) * (state OR 4)

function transform_C(state):
    // Mixes addition with a magic constant and bitwise AND.
    return (state + 0xbaaad0bf) * (state AND 5)

function transform_D(state):
    // Uses bitwise AND with the magic constant and adds 3.
    return (state AND 0xbaaad0bf) * (state + 3)
```

### Explanation

*   **Initialization:**  
    A starting state and a control byte (or flag) are set up. In the original code these were stored in stack variables.
    
*   **Global Conditions:**  
    The code repeatedly “checks” globals (addresses 0x404000 and 0x404004). When both are 0, the computed tests (such as “0 < 10”) always pass.
    
*   **Primary Transformation:**  
    Depending on the value of `control1` (tested by its lowest bit), the code applies either transformation variant A or variant B.
    
    *   Variant A uses an OR with the magic constant and a XOR with 2.
        
    *   Variant B uses a XOR with the magic constant and an OR with 4.
        
*   **Secondary Transformation:**  
    A secondary control flag (`control2`) is computed from the state. Based on that flag, the code applies:
    
    *   Variant D: uses AND with the magic constant and adds 3, or
        
    *   Variant C: adds the magic constant and uses AND with 5.
        
*   **Loop & Termination:**  
    The loop repeats these transformation steps until an internal termination condition (dependent on the evolving state) is met.
    

While the actual assembly is far more convoluted (with many extra register adjustments and jumps to confuse analysis), this pseudocode captures its core logic in a structured and more understandable form.
